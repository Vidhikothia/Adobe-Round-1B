# Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent document analysis system that tailors content extraction based on the needs of a specific **persona** and their **job-to-be-done**. Given a set of documents (PDFs), the system identifies and prioritizes the most relevant sections aligned with the persona's role and objective.

## Objective

Design a generic and scalable solution capable of understanding:
- Diverse document types (research papers, textbooks, reports, etc.)
- Various personas (students, researchers, analysts, etc.)
- Specific job-driven goals (e.g., literature review, exam preparation, business insight)

## Sample Use Cases

- A **PhD researcher** reviewing methodologies from scientific papers
- An **investment analyst** comparing financial reports
- A **student** preparing for chemistry exams

## Key Features

- Semantic understanding of documents
- Persona-specific relevance extraction
- Task-oriented content summarization
